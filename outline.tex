Paper 1: signaling & scrambling in power-law systems
2: fast quantum fanout using power-law interactions
3: clustering of correlations in steady states of power-law systems
4: experimental implementation of state transfer protocols(?)

Thread that connects all of these papers? Long-range interactions. quantum information, speed limits, entanglement.

In section 1, we present two Lieb-Robinson bounds on the signaling times in strongly long-range systems. The first bound applies to free particles. The second applies to interacting systems.

Outline for introduction:
Problems: modern architectures have limited connectivities and short coherence times
best theoretical bounds unknown for alpha <= d -->
best theoretical bounds unknown for open systems --> correlation decay in steady states --> area-laws for classical simulation

protocols: signaling & scrambling, fast fanout gate
bounds: signaling & scrambling and open systems LR

intro: many-body systems, quantum computation,
