\chapter{Background}
Without loss of generality, we study a generic interacting spin Hamiltonian $ 	H(t) = \sum_{i<j} h_{ij}(t)$ where $\|h_{ij}(t)\|\le 1/r_{ij}^{\alpha}$ and on-site interactions have been eliminated by going into an interaction picture.
We will bound the quantity $\|[A(t),B]\|$, where $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary operators supported on sets of sites $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
We consider now the case of signaling between subsystems $X$ and $Y$ of a system $\Lam$ with $|X|,|Y|=\O{1}$.
We formally define $t_\text{si}$\dash the signaling time from $X$ to $Y$\dash as the smallest time $t$ such that for a fixed constant $\delta=\Theta(1)$, there exist unit-norm operators $A$ and $B$ supported on $X$ and $Y$ respectively such that $\|[A(t),B]\| > \delta$ \cite{Lashkari13}.
