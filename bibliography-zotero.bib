  abstract = {The Swap gate is a ubiquitous tool for moving information on quantum hardware, yet it can be considered a classical operation because it does not entangle product states. Genuinely quantum operations could outperform Swap for the task of permuting qubits within an architecture, which we call routing. We consider quantum routing in two models: (1) allowing arbitrary two-qubit unitaries, or (2) allowing Hamiltonians with norm-bounded interactions. We lower bound the circuit depth or time of quantum routing in terms of spectral properties of graphs representing the architecture interaction constraints, and give a generalized upper bound for all simple connected \$n\$-vertex graphs. In particular, we give conditions for a superpolynomial classical-quantum routing separation, which exclude graphs with a small spectral gap and graphs of bounded degree. Finally, we provide examples of a quadratic separation between gate-based and Hamiltonian routing models with a constant number of local ancillas per qubit and of an \$\textbackslash Omega(n)\$ speedup if we also allow fast local interactions.},

  abstract = {A promising approach to merge atomic systems with scalable photonics has emerged recently, which consists of trapping cold atoms near tapered nanofibers. Here, we describe a novel technique to achieve strong, coherent coupling between a single atom and photon in such a system. Our approach makes use of collective enhancement effects, which allow a lattice of atoms to form a high-finesse cavity within the fiber. We show that a specially designated `impurity' atom within the cavity can experience strongly enhanced interactions with single photons in the fiber. Under realistic conditions, a `strong coupling' regime can be reached, wherein it becomes feasible to observe vacuum Rabi oscillations between the excited impurity atom and a single cavity quantum. This technique can form the basis for a scalable quantum information network using atom\textendash nanofiber systems.}

Experiments in this field have progressed enormously, and several groups are pursuing advanced apparatus for manipulation of molecules with electric fields as well as single-atom-resolved in situ detection. Such detection has become ubiquitous for atoms in optical lattices and tweezer arrays, but has yet to be demonstrated for ultracold polar molecules. Here we present a proposal for the implementation of site-resolved microscopy for polar molecules, and specifically discuss a technique for spin-resolved molecular detection. We use numerical simulation of spin dynamics of lattice-confined polar molecules to show how such a scheme would be of utility in a spin-diffusion experiment.},

However, many experimental systems have interactions that decay with distance, and the achievable benefits in this context are much less clear. Combining recent exact solutions with a controlled expansion in the system size, we analyze quench dynamics in Ising models with power-law (\$1/r\^\{\textbackslash alpha\}\$) interactions in \$D\$ dimensions, thereby expanding the understanding of spin squeezing into a broad and experimentally relevant context. In spatially homogeneous systems, we show that for small \$\textbackslash alpha\$ the scaling of squeezing with system size is identical to the infinite-range (\$\textbackslash alpha=0\$) case. This indifference to the interaction range persists up to a critical value \$\textbackslash alpha=2D/3\$, above which squeezing degrades continuously. Boundary-induced inhomogeneities present in most experimental systems modify this picture, but it nevertheless remains qualitatively correct for finite-sized systems.},

Here, we show that unexpected topological properties take place in a paradigmatic strongly correlated Hamiltonian: the 1D extended Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we reveal the presence of two distinct topological quantum critical points with localized edge states and gapless bulk excitations. Our results show that the topological critical points separate two phases, one topologically protected and the other topologically trivial, both characterized by a long-range ordered string correlation function. The long-range order persists also at the topological critical points and explains the presence of localized edge states protected by a finite charge gap. Finally, we introduce a superresolution quantum gas microscopy scheme for dipolar dysprosium atoms, which provides a reliable route towards the experimental study of topological quantum critical points.},

They are present in leading experimental platforms for quantum computation and simulation, as well as in theoretical models of quantum information scrambling and fast entanglement creation. Since no notion of locality is expected in such systems, a general understanding of their dynamics is lacking. As a first step towards rectifying this problem, we prove two new Lieb-Robinson-type bounds that constrain the time for signaling and scrambling in strongly long-range interacting systems, for which no tight bounds were previously known. Our first bound applies to systems mappable to free-particle Hamiltonians with long-range hopping, and is saturable for \$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash le D/2\$. Our second bound pertains to generic long-range interacting spin Hamiltonians, and leads to a tight lower bound for the signaling time to extensive subsets of the system for all \$\textbackslash alpha {$<$} D\$. This result also lower-bounds the scrambling time, and suggests a path towards achieving a tight scrambling bound that can prove the long-standing fast scrambling conjecture.},

  abstract = {The standard circuit model for quantum computation presumes the ability to directly perform gates between arbitrary pairs of qubits, which is unlikely to be practical for large-scale experiments. Power-law interactions with strength decaying as \$1/r\^\textbackslash alpha\$ in the distance \$r\$ provide an experimentally realizable resource for information processing, whilst still retaining long-range connectivity. We leverage the power of these interactions to implement a fast quantum fanout gate with an arbitrary number of targets. Our implementation allows the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and Shor's algorithm to be performed on a \$D\$-dimensional lattice in time logarithmic in the number of qubits for interactions with \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash le D\$. As a corollary, we show that power-law systems with \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash le D\$ are difficult to simulate classically even for short times, under a standard assumption that factoring is classically intractable. Complementarily, we develop a new technique to give a general lower bound, linear in the size of the system, on the time required to implement the QFT and the fanout gate in systems that are constrained by a linear light cone. This allows us to prove an asymptotically tighter lower bound for long-range systems than is possible with previously available techniques.},

  abstract = {A family of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on finite dimensional quantum state spaces is introduced. The framework of non-commutative Lp-spaces is reviewed and the relationship between quantum logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and the hypercontractivity of quantum semigroups is discussed. This relationship is central for the derivation of lower bounds for the logarithmic Sobolev (LS) constants. Essential results for the family of inequalities are proved, and we show an upper bound to the generalized LS constant in terms of the spectral gap of the generator of the semigroup. These inequalities provide a framework for the derivation of improved bounds on the convergence time of quantum dynamical semigroups, when the LS constant and the spectral gap are of the same order. Convergence bounds on finite dimensional state spaces are particularly relevant for the field of quantum information theory. We provide a number of examples, where improved bounds on the mixing time of several semigroups are obtained, including the depolarizing semigroup and quantum expanders. \textcopyright{} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The time required for thermalization to occur in such models should reflect the relaxation times associated with classical black holes in general relativity. Moreover, the time required for a particularly strong form of thermalization to occur, sometimes known as scrambling, determines the time scale on which black holes should start to release information. It has been conjectured that black holes scramble in a time logarithmic in their entropy, and that no system in nature can scramble faster. In this article, we address the conjecture from two directions. First, we exhibit two examples of systems that do indeed scramble in logarithmic time: Brownian quantum circuits and the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a sparse random graph. Unfortunately, both fail to be truly ideal fast scramblers for reasons we discuss. Second, we use Lieb-Robinson techniques to prove a logarithmic lower bound on the scrambling time of systems with finite norm terms in their Hamiltonian. The bound holds in spite of any nonlocal structure in the Hamiltonian, which might permit every degree of freedom to interact directly with every other one.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers can efficiently solve classically intractable problems, such as the factorization of a large number1 and the simulation of quantum many-body systems2,3. Universal quantum computation can be simplified by decomposing circuits into single- and two-qubit entangling gates4, but such decomposition is not necessarily efficient. It has been suggested that polynomial or exponential speedups can be obtained with global N-qubit (N greater than two) entangling gates5\textendash 9. Such global gates involve all-to-all connectivity, which emerges among trapped-ion qubits when using laser-driven collective motional modes10\textendash 14, and have been implemented for a single motional mode15,16. However, the single-mode approach is difficult to scale up because isolating single modes becomes challenging as the number of ions increases in a single crystal, and multi-mode schemes are scalable17,18 but limited to pairwise gates19\textendash 23. Here we propose and implement a scalable scheme for realizing global entangling gates on multiple 171Yb+ ion qubits by coupling to multiple motional modes through modulated laser fields. Because such global gates require decoupling multiple modes and balancing all pairwise coupling strengths during the gate, we develop a system with fully independent control capability on each ion14. To demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of these global gates, we generate a Greenberger\textendash Horne\textendash Zeilinger state with up to four qubits using a single global operation. Our approach realizes global entangling gates as scalable building blocks for universal quantum computation, motivating future research in scalable global methods for quantum information processing.},

  abstract = {In quantum many-body systems with local interactions, quantum information and entanglement cannot spread outside of a linear light cone, which expands at an emergent velocity analogous to the speed of light. Local operations at sufficiently separated spacetime points approximately commute\textemdash given a many-body state |{$\psi\rangle$}, Ox(t)Oy|{$\psi\rangle\approx$}OyOx(t)|{$\psi\rangle$} with arbitrarily small errors\textemdash so long as |x-y|{$\greaterequivlnt$}vt, where v is finite. Yet, most nonrelativistic physical systems realized in nature have long-range interactions: Two degrees of freedom separated by a distance r interact with potential energy V(r){$\propto$}1/r{$\alpha$}. In systems with long-range interactions, we rigorously establish a hierarchy of linear light cones: At the same {$\alpha$}, some quantum information processing tasks are constrained by a linear light cone, while others are not. In one spatial dimension, this linear light cone exists for every many-body state |{$\psi\rangle$} when {$\alpha>$}3 (Lieb-Robinson light cone); for a typical state |{$\psi\rangle$} chosen uniformly at random from the Hilbert space when {$\alpha>$}52 (Frobenius light cone); and for every state of a noninteracting system when {$\alpha>$}2 (free light cone). These bounds apply to time-dependent systems and are optimal up to subalgebraic improvements. Our theorems regarding the Lieb-Robinson and free light cones\textemdash and their tightness\textemdash also generalize to arbitrary dimensions. We discuss the implications of our bounds on the growth of connected correlators and of topological order, the clustering of correlations in gapped systems, and the digital simulation of systems with long-range interactions. In addition, we show that universal quantum state transfer, as well as many-body quantum chaos, is bounded by the Frobenius light cone and, therefore, is poorly constrained by all Lieb-Robinson bounds.},

  abstract = {For a quantum computer to be useful, its qubits have to be able to change their state in response to external stimuli. But when a large number of qubits are packed in a three-dimensional (3D) structure to optimize the use of space, altering one qubit can unintentionally change the state of others. Wang et al. devised a clever way to perform high-fidelity quantum gates only on intended qubits in a 3D array of Cs atoms. Although the operation initially changed the state of some of the other atoms, additional manipulation recovered their original state. The technique may be applicable to other quantum computing implementations.Science, this issue p. 1562Although the quality of individual quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates has been steadily improving, the number of qubits in a single system has increased quite slowly. Here, we demonstrate arbitrary single-qubit gates based on targeted phase shifts, an approach that can be applied to atom, ion, or other atom-like systems. These gates are highly insensitive to addressing beam imperfections and have little cross-talk, allowing for a dramatic scaling up of qubit number. We have performed gates in series on 48 individually targeted sites in a 40\% full 5 by 5 by 5 three-dimensional array created by an optical lattice. Using randomized benchmarking, we demonstrate an average gate fidelity of 0.9962(16), with an average cross-talk fidelity of 0.9979(2) (numbers in parentheses indicate the one standard deviation uncertainty in the final digits).},
